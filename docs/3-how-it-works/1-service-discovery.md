# Service discovery

## Discovery by reference

Applications become aware of peer services through dynamic references. Developers already know which services they need to call, so all we have to do is let them index it.

## Localized API gateways

Just like environments use API gateways to customize routing behavior, developers can use them to do the same, but scoped to the services in their domain.

## Load balancing for every service

Every service automatically is deployed as a horizontally scalable set, and every call to the set is automatically load balanced.

## (Coming soon) Automated traceability
