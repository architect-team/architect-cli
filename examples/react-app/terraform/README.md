## Automated infrastructure management and deployments

A GitHub workflow is included in the `github` directory which contains a workflow to deploy the component automatically after a branch is merged to master. If you would like to use it to deploy the component automatically, move it to the folder `.github/workflows` in your own repo. The root of the repository should also contain the `architect.yml` file and the full `frontend` and `backend` directories. Be sure to add the following secrets on your GitHub repository's settings page:

TODO: document other variables

* ARCHITECT_EMAIL
* ARCHITECT_PASSWORD (This will be a personal access token generated by you on the Architect Cloud.)
* ACCOUNT_NAME
* ENVIRONMENT_NAME
* POSTGRES_HOST (This was printed as an output if you've created your infrastructure with terraform and can also be found on your AWS dashboard)

Note that the name of the component, `examples/react-app`, should also be changed to `<your_account_name>/react-app` in the `architect.yml` file. The GitHub workflow also assumes that you've already created an Architect platform and environment. If you've used terraform to create your infrastructure, the Kubernetes config file to create your Architect platform will have been created in the same directory in which the `terraform` commands were run.


TODO: what content do we actually want here?

will the terraform ever be run locally? or just within the github workflow? what flows/use cases do we actually want to document?
dependencies - architect account, terraform, awscli, architect, aws user credentials and permissions
setting up a github workflow
what github secrets to set if using the github workflow



add platform and environment creation workflow/no op and echo platform exists
artifacts to pass vars between jobs - terraform/architect jobs
