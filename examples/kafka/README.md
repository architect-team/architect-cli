# Kafka

This example Kafka project will start up a message publisher and a message subscriber as well as [ZooKeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/) and [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) to facilitate communication between services. Messages will be passed from the publisher, to a Kafka topic, then finally to the subscriber on a regular cadence.

## Running locally

Architect component specs are declarative, so it can be run locally or remotely with a single deploy command:

```sh
# Clone the repository and navigate to this directory
$ git clone https://github.com/architect-team/architect-cli.git
$ cd ./architect-cli/examples/kafka

# Deploy using the dev command
$ architect dev ./architect.yml
```

Once the deploy has completed, you can see messages being passed between services in the logs.

## Deploying to the cloud

Want to try deploying this to a cloud environment? Architect's got you covered there too! if you've already [created your account](https://cloud.architect.io/signup), you can run the command below to deploy the component to a sample Kubernetes cluster powered by Architect Cloud:

```sh
$ architect deploy ./architect.yml -e example-environment
```
